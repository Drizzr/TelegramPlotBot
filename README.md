# TelegramPlotBot

This TelegramBot is capable of creating a graph for all t->value measurements! There is even an option to select a specific period within the measured data.

To use this bot you have to asign your bot-token and chat-id to the corresponding variables in the TelegramBot class (main.py-file).
After you type start in telegram the bot gets activated. (Note: sometimes you might have to type start two times)
